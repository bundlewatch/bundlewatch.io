# Diffing Against Branches Other Than Master
After running through [using bundlewatch](getting-started/using-bundlewatch.md), BundleWatch will automatically diff against master.

If you want to set up diffing for other branches (e.g. develop) there is one more CI variable that is required.
- `CI_BRANCH_BASE`
